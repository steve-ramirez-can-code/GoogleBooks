### Overview

This app was created as coding challenge at first but I'd like to expand upon and make it a more fleshed out application. 

This app is desgined to interact with the GoogleBooks API and return all pertinent information related to potential search queries and criteria.

## Updates

Added all of my pertinent code. Was able to get a successfully satisfactory product. Would like to work on any more potential edge cases. Was able to deal with empty strings, letters being used in the ISBN search query, nonsensical queries that would return an error, and null values. 

## Potential Features

Would like to add the possibility to add multiple search queries at a time and to make the app a little more aesthetically pleasing. For now, it's adequate and should be able to do what it was initally intended to do.  

Heroku Link is https://readingassistant.herokuapp.com/

Potentially new features for app:
- Ability to choose how many search results are returned. Currenly only 10 at a time. 
- Ability to remove some search results and populate with new ones.

### Project Creation 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
